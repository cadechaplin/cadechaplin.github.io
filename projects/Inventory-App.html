            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              The ACME Food Bank Inventory System is a comprehensive solution
              designed to streamline donation tracking, ensure timely usage of
              perishable items, and generate detailed reports. Built with the
              MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js), it provides a
              secure and efficient platform for managing food bank operations.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              Food banks often struggle with inventory management, particularly
              tracking perishable items and their expiration dates. Manual
              processes lead to food waste, inefficient distribution, and
              challenges in reporting to stakeholders. The ACME Food Bank needed
              a system to efficiently track donations, monitor expiration dates,
              and provide role-based access for different types of users.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>

                <h3>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)</h3>
                <p>
                  The system implements comprehensive RBAC with distinct roles
                  including Admin, Employee, Volunteer, User, and Donor. Each
                  role has specific permissions tailored to their
                  responsibilities within the food bank operation, ensuring
                  secure and appropriate access to features.

                <h3>Donation & Inventory Management</h3>
                <p>
                  The application provides robust features for tracking
                  donations and managing inventory. Users can record new
                  donations, categorize items by type (perishable,
                  non-perishable), assign storage locations, and track donor
                  information. The inventory view offers advanced sorting and
                  filtering capabilities to easily find and manage items.

                <h3>Expiration Tracking & Reporting</h3>
                <p>
                  The system highlights items nearing expiration to prevent food
                  waste. Comprehensive reporting tools allow staff to generate
                  monthly inventory reports, track items expiring within
                  specified timeframes, and export data to CSV for further
                  analysis. This ensures efficient use of resources and aids in
                  planning and decision-making.

                <p>
                  To ensure the highest level of security for sensitive food
                  bank data, the system implements two-factor authentication for
                  admin and employee accounts. This additional layer of
                  protection helps prevent unauthorized access and safeguards
                  donor information and inventory records.

            <h2>Development Approach</h2>
            <p>
              The application was developed using an Agile methodology with
              sprints focused on incremental feature implementation. The MERN
              stack was chosen for its flexibility, performance, and scalability
              in web applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              MongoDB provides a flexible schema for varied inventory items,
              Express.js offers a robust API framework, React delivers a
              responsive and interactive user interface, and Node.js ensures
              efficient server-side processing. The project follows a modular
              architecture with clear separation of concerns between frontend
              and backend components.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Role-Based Security:</strong> Implementing a comprehensive
              RBAC system was challenging. The solution involved creating a
              hierarchical role structure with well-defined permissions that
              controlled access at both the frontend and backend levels.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Expiration Management:</strong> Tracking perishable items
              effectively required designing a system that could filter, sort,
              and highlight items based on expiration status. Custom date
              handling and visual indicators were implemented to make expiring
              items immediately obvious.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>User Authentication:</strong> Securing the system while
              maintaining usability was addressed by implementing JWT
              authentication with two-factor authentication (2FA) support,
              providing a balance between security and convenience.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              The ACME Food Bank Inventory System successfully addresses the
              challenges of food bank inventory management with a secure,
              user-friendly solution. Key outcomes include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Streamlined donation processing and inventory tracking</li>
              <li>
                Reduced food waste through effective expiration monitoring
              </li>
              <li>
                Enhanced reporting capabilities for better decision-making
              </li>
              <li>Improved security through role-based access control</li>
              <li>
                User-friendly interface accessible on mobile and desktop devices
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The application demonstrates how the MERN stack can be leveraged
              to create efficient, secure inventory management systems for
              organizations with complex tracking needs.
