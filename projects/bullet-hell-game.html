            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This Greek mythology-themed bullet hell game is a 2D shooter
              developed as part of the Software Design (CPTS 487) class at
              Washington State University. Built using the MonoGame/XNA
              framework, it challenges players to dodge waves of enemy
              projectiles while progressing through different mythological
              encounters.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              Creating a bullet hell game involves solving complex technical
              challenges including efficient collision detection with many
              entities, managing game state, implementing enemy AI with diverse
              attack patterns, and ensuring smooth performance even with
              hundreds of projectiles on screen simultaneously.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>

                <h3>Dynamic Wave System</h3>
                <p>
                  The game features a JSON-driven wave system that controls
                  enemy spawning and behavior patterns. This data-driven
                  approach allows for easy creation of new levels and enemy
                  types without modifying code. Each wave progressively
                  increases in difficulty, challenging players to improve their
                  skills.

                <h3>Boss Encounters</h3>
                <p>
                  The game includes a mid-boss (Minotaur) and final boss (Zeus)
                  with unique attack combinations and patterns defined in
                  separate configuration files. These challenging encounters
                  test player reflexes and pattern recognition with complex
                  bullet patterns and phase-based behaviors.

                  Players can collect various power-ups dropped by defeated
                  enemies to enhance their capabilities. These include health
                  restoration, temporary shields, and damage boosts. The
                  power-up system adds strategic depth as players must decide
                  when to risk collecting items during intense battles.

            <h2>Implementation Challenges</h2>

            <h3>Collision Detection Optimization</h3>
            <p>
              With potentially hundreds of bullets on screen simultaneously,
              naive collision detection would cause significant performance
              issues. We implemented optimized collision detection systems to
              maintain performance while accurately detecting hits between
              players, enemies, and projectiles.
            </p>

            <h3>Complex Enemy Behavior Patterns</h3>
            <p>
              To create engaging enemy behavior, we designed a pattern system
              that combines basic movements with various attack patterns. These
              components are configured through JSON files to create diverse and
              challenging enemies without code changes.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome & Learnings</h2>
            <p>
              This project provided valuable experience in game development
              principles, including game loops, sprite rendering, collision
              detection, and state management. The data-driven approach to enemy
              waves and patterns created a flexible system that could be
              expanded with new content without significant code changes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Performance optimization became a key learning area, as
              maintaining good framerate with many entities required careful
              attention to memory allocation patterns and efficient algorithms.
              The team-based development process also provided valuable
              experience in collaborative software design and implementation.
