            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
              This Spreadsheet Application is a cross-platform desktop
              application built with C# and Avalonia UI that provides core
              spreadsheet functionality with formula support, cell referencing,
              and error handling. It features a clean, intuitive interface with
              undo/redo capabilities and multi-cell selection.
            </p>

            <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>
              Many spreadsheet applications are either platform-specific or
              overly complex. The goal was to create a lightweight,
              cross-platform solution that focuses on core spreadsheet
              functionality while maintaining a clean code structure and proper
              error handling.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>

                <h3>Formula Support & Cell Referencing</h3>
                <p>
                  The application supports mathematical formulas and references
                  to other cells. Users can create complex calculations that
                  automatically update when referenced cells change. The formula
                  parsing system handles parentheses, operators, and functions
                  with proper precedence rules.

                <h3>Error Handling & Circular Reference Detection</h3>
                <p>
                  The spreadsheet implements robust error handling for formula
                  parsing and evaluation. It detects circular references before
                  they cause infinite loops, providing clear feedback to users
                  about the problem and highlighting the affected cells.

                <h3>Undo & Redo Functionality</h3>
                <p>
                  All actions in the spreadsheet can be undone and redone,
                  providing users with flexibility and confidence when making
                  changes. The application maintains a history stack of
                  operations allowing for multiple levels of undo/redo.

                <p>
                  Users can select multiple cells using shift-click or by
                  dragging across the grid. The application also highlights
                  cells being referenced by formulas, helping users understand
                  dependencies between cells.

                  Spreadsheets can be saved to and opened from XML files,
                  preserving all cell data, formulas, and formatting. The XML
                  structure is designed to be both human-readable and efficient
                  for parsing.

            <h2>Development Approach</h2>
            <p>
              The application was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
              principles, ensuring high code quality and thorough test coverage.
              StyleCop was used to maintain consistent code style and
              readability across the codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              The project follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture
              pattern, separating the UI logic from the business logic and
              making the code more maintainable and testable.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges & Solutions</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Formula Evaluation Challenge:</strong> Creating a robust
              formula parser that could handle complex expressions while
              maintaining good performance was challenging. The solution was to
              implement a custom expression evaluator that converts formulas
              into abstract syntax trees.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Circular Reference Detection:</strong> Detecting circular
              dependencies between cells required careful implementation. I
              developed a directed graph approach to track cell dependencies and
              run cycle detection algorithms before evaluating formulas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Cross-Platform UI:</strong> Ensuring consistent UI
              behavior across different operating systems was solved by using
              Avalonia UI, which provides a unified API for Windows, macOS, and
              Linux platforms.
            </p>

            <h2>Outcome</h2>
            <p>
              The result is a streamlined yet powerful spreadsheet application
              with a focus on core functionality, stability, and cross-platform
              compatibility. The clean architecture and comprehensive test
              coverage make it easy to maintain and extend with new features.
